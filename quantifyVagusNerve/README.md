# quantifyVagusNerve
 
This repository contains a pipeline that represents the segmented unmyelinated axons in several vagus and pelvic nerve cross-sections as spatial point patterns, and computes Sinkhorn distance between certain spatial features of the point patterns and their corresponding images, to quantify spatial inhomogeneity and anisotropy in the peripheral nerve cross-sections.
