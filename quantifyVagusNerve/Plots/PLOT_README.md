# Plots
 
The directory **spatial-neuro/quantifyVagusNerve/Plots/** contains the output plots and files in separate subdirectories. The *.xlsx* files saved here contains the Sinkhorn distance matrices and we can visualize the nerve samples in the Sinkhorn space of the corresponding spatial features by applying multi-dimensional scaling on them.
