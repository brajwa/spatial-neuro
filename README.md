# SpatialNeuro

The reporistory contains R-scripts and R-markdown notebooks demonstrating the use of spatial analysis tools for processing some peripheral neuroscience-related imgage data. Specifically, it shows the use of network analysis for quantifying interganglionic connections, and the use of spatial point pattern analysis to quantify the differences between the arrangement of axons visible in cross-sections through vagus nerves. 

The project used funding provided by the NIH Common Fund under SPARC OT2 (Stimulating Peripheral Activity to Relieve Conditions) award OD023847.
